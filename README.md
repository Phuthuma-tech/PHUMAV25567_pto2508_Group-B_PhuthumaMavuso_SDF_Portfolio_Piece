## 🧪 How You’ll Be Marked

Your project will be assessed using **two components**:

### ✅ 1. Code & Layout Marking 
Each section of your resume site is scored based on:
- Use of semantic HTML and correct structure
- Accurate styling, spacing, typography, and colour matching the Figma
- Pixel accuracy for layout and alignment
- Responsive layout on mobile screens
- Clean and well-structured code
- Functional and visually polished components
- Accessibility (e.g., alt text for images and icons)

> A full breakdown of the scoring rubric is available on your Dashboard. Each feature is mapped to a clear user story and assigned a difficulty rating. Some features offer bonus points for pixel-perfection ✨

### 🎙️ 2. Recorded Presentation 
You must record a **5–10 minute** screen presentation of your project using Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder.

You will be scored on:
- How well you explain your code and decisions
- Understanding and communication of the project brief
- Visual walkthrough of your site and responsiveness
- Presentation skills (confidence, clarity, visual aids)
